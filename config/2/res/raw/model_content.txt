The town itself looks quiet but not how you left it. It looks almost defeated. Your heart starts to beat noticeably faster, pounding away in your chest as you think back, as you remember your encounter with the witch Bella Constantine.

Unfortunately for you the boot was heading towards your chest so you take the blow right on the top of the head, fortunately it's not as strong a blow as you recall the last being.
